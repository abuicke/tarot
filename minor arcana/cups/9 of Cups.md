# 9 of Cups

**Key Word:** Optimism  
**Song:**   
**Hexagrams:** 



### Upright

1) An **optimistic outlook** for the future. Seeing what you have and what's working for you instead of paying attention to what you lack.



### Reversed

1) An **unhappy situation**. Since this card is a nine, and therefore represents Yesod in its suit (a matrix), it gives me the feeling it's a situation that cannot be rectified without breaking it apart.<sup>1</sup>



### Extra





### Footnotes

1. See: The Tower.
