# 9 of Cups

**Key Word:** Optimism  
**Song:** [Fast Car by Tracey Chapman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIOAlaACuv4)

### Upright

1) An **optimistic outlook** for the future. Seeing what you have and what's working for you instead of paying attention to what you lack.

1) An **unhappy situation**.
