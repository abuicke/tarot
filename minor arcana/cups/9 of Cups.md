# 9 of Cups

**Key Word:** Happiness  
**Song:** [Shine by Bishop Gunn](https://youtube.com/watch?v=F3A_coTcUek)  
**Hexagrams:** 



### Upright

1) An **optimistic** outlook for the future. Seeing what you have and what's working for you instead of paying attention to what you lack.
2) **Happiness**, **contentment**.



### Reversed

1) An **unhappy** situation. Since this card is a nine, and therefore represents Yesod in its suit (a matrix), it gives me the feeling it's a situation that cannot be rectified without breaking it apart.<sup>1</sup>
2) Misery, frustration.
