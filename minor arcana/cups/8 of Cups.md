# 8 of Cups

**Key Word:** Renunciation  
**Song:**   
**Hexagrams:** 



### Upright

1) Loss of heart (but with the possibility of renunciation to achieve something greater than what was lost).
2) A hardness/coolness of emotions. Not feeling where they may have otherwise been (intense) emotion.
3) Detachment from emotion which can lead to (renunciate) clarity - seeing more clearly after withdrawal from a situation.
4) Renunciation. Abdicating emotions for a spiritual ideal (higher purpose).



### Reversed

1) Release of emotional energy (positive or negative).
2) Letting go of emotional defensiveness; willing to simply be one's self and accept what comes with that.



### Extra

>It is instructive to compare planetary Saturn’s effect on Hod in this card, with Mercury’s effect on Supernal Saturn in the 3 of Cups. Other similar reciprocal examples occur throughout this essay.
