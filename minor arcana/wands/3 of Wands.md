### Upright

1) Virtue, **courage**, bravery. A cool certainty of one's path.



### Reversed

1) Lacking courage
2) Fear and anxiety
3) Lack of a centre point (from which to operate). Being tossed about by the astral weather of emotion, from on extreme to another, not maintaining an ataraxic vantage point from whichy to weather the storm. A person's energies (whether positive or negative) are tossing them about, going from one pole to the other. They are not teathered to a stable centre within.<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup>



### Card Description
