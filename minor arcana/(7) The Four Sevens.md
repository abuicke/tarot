# The Four Sevens

In the sevens things become clouded. There is a lack of certainty. The suit has lost its way, unsure of what it wants or what to do next.

This manifests itself as valour and courage in the case of the Wands—success not being certain<sup>1</sup>. For valour, courage, and boldness are the qualities of Will that isn't sure what it's up against. In this way the 7 of Wands is not as regal as its predecessor, the 6, but has its own virtues which recommend it, for forward movement and intention in the face of what is not certain is bravery.

Unsurprisingly, things don't work out as well in the remaining suits, as they are not strong enough to overcome the limitations of seven. Cups give way to delusion, Swords give way to futility (empty thinking), and Disks give way to abject failure<sup>2</sup>—not knowing what direction to grow in, they fail (although this can be corrected, and as such, its alternative title "Success Unfulfilled" may be more appropriate).



### Footnotes

1. "Valor, zeal, passion; opposition, obstacles, and difficulties, yet courage and self-confidence to meet them; possible victory, depending on the energy and courage exercised" - *Liber Theta* (College of Thelema, 2012), p. 41
2. "The present title, 'Failure,' is far too drastic. The older title ['Success Unfulfilled']...usually should be construed to mean, 'Success Unfulfilled Thus Far.' It often includes the idea of patience, and endurance through the passage of time, and the need for labor and effort, which are those elements required on the plane of Earth in order to achieve Victory." - **Frater Π**, *Liber Theta* (College of Thelema, 2012), p. 58
