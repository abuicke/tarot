# The Four Fives

Geburah is that aspect of life which is loss, pain, the self-correcting aspect of nature which balances<sup>1</sup> birth with death, pleasure<sup>2</sup> with pain, and gain with loss. As such, the 5s all cost us something.

1) The 5 of Disks costs us our physical vitality, and a harmonious<sup>3</sup> material situation.
2) The 5 of Swords costs us our peace of<sup>4</sup> mind.
3) The 5 of Cups costs us our emotional equanimity.
4) The 5 of Wands costs us our easy path forward.

**Question:** What is the difference between the 4s and the 6s? Fundamentally?
