>**The Parable of the Hidden Jewel**
>
>A poor man visits a wealthy friend. After spending some time together, the wealthy friend, noticing the poor manâ€™s destitution, decides to help him. While the poor man is asleep, the wealthy friend sews a precious jewel into the lining of his robe without telling him. When the poor man wakes up, he leaves, unaware of the hidden jewel in his robe.
>
>Years later, the two friends meet again. The wealthy friend is surprised to see that the poor man is still living in poverty. He asks the poor man why he did not use the jewel to improve his life. The poor man is astonished to learn about the jewel sewn into his robe and realizes that he has been carrying this great wealth all along without knowing it.
