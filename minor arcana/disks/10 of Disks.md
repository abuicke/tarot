**The Parable of the Hidden Jewel**

A poor man visits a wealthy friend. After spending some time together, the wealthy friend, noticing the poor man’s destitution, decides to help him. While the poor man is asleep, the wealthy friend sews a precious jewel into the lining of his robe without telling him. When the poor man wakes up, he leaves, unaware of the hidden jewel in his robe.

Years later, the two friends meet again. The wealthy friend is surprised to see that the poor man is still living in poverty. He asks the poor man why he did not use the jewel to improve his life. The poor man is astonished to learn about the jewel sewn into his robe and realizes that he has been carrying this great wealth all along without knowing it.

>Naropa's foremost student was a Tibetan named Marpa the Translator. On one of his trips to India, Marpa had collected the traditional gold to give to the teacher. Now Marpa was not exactly a coward, and he was not exactly stingy; he was a very bold, gutsy kind of fellow. For instance, his friends and family tried to get someone to walk with him from Tibet to India, and he refused to have company, even though his health wasn't all that good and he was over fifty years old. 
>
>So the story goes that Marpa made his final gift of gold to his teacher Naropa, but he kept a little back—just as we always do. And there was a reasonable explanation for this: he had to travel home, and he needed a little gold—just a little. But Naropa said, "Do you think you can buy me with your deception?" So Marpa gave him all of it. Naropa threw the gold up into the air and said, "The whole world is gold to me." At that point Marpa realized the nature of reality more vividly than ever before.

>Compared to any other flower, a lily blooms fastest, you know? Within about an hour’s time, from an uninteresting bud, it becomes a spectacular flower. How many of you took time to sit there for an hour and watch it actually opening up?
>
>"No, watching a flower bloom? We got more important things to do. Because if we have time, we will go into our room and open the computer and watch a video, why will I sit and watch a goddamn flower blooming?"
>
>That is the reason why you don’t flower for a long time, because you do not know how to pay attention to the smallest detail of your life. If you do not know how to pay attention to this breath, what is there to watch? Then you're missing the whole point.

>So it is because of this that spiritual process seems to be sitting up there in the sky. It is not sitting up there in the sky; it is very earthy. It is something that every human being can do, but most never ever do.

>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal. But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

### Footnotes

1. [*Wealth*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZWeFtgEAEk) by Chris Rock
2. "The Ten of Disks is called Wealth. Here again is written this constantly recurring doctrine, that as soon as one gets to the bottom one finds oneself at the top; and Wealth is given to Mercury in Virgo. When wealth accumulates beyond a certain point, it must either become completely inert and cease to be wealth, or call in the aid of intelligence to use it rightly. This must necessarily happen in spheres which have nothing whatever to do with material possessions, as such. In this way, Carnegie establishes a Library, Rockefeller endows Research, simply because there is nothing else to do. But all this doctrine lies behind the card; it is the inner meaning of the card." - **Aleister Crowley**, *The Book of Thoth* (Weiser, 2008), p. 188
