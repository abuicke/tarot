>**The Parable of the Hidden Jewel**
>
>A poor man visits a wealthy friend. After spending some time together, the wealthy friend, noticing the poor man’s destitution, decides to help him. While the poor man is asleep, the wealthy friend sews a precious jewel into the lining of his robe without telling him. When the poor man wakes up, he leaves, unaware of the hidden jewel in his robe.
>
>Years later, the two friends meet again. The wealthy friend is surprised to see that the poor man is still living in poverty. He asks the poor man why he did not use the jewel to improve his life. The poor man is astonished to learn about the jewel sewn into his robe and realizes that he has been carrying this great wealth all along without knowing it.

>Naropa's foremost student was a Tibetan named Marpa the Translator. On one of his trips to India, Marpa had collected the traditional gold to give to the teacher. Now Marpa was not exactly a coward, and he was not exactly stingy; he was a very bold, gutsy kind of fellow. For instance, his friends and family tried to get someone to walk with him from Tibet to India, and he refused to have company, even though his health wasn't all that good and he was over fifty years old. 
>
>So the story goes that Marpa made his final gift of gold to his teacher Naropa, but he kept a little back-just as we al- ways do. And there was a reasonable explanation for this: he had to travel home, and he needed a little gold-just a little. But Naropa said, "Do you think you can buy me with your deception?" So Marpa gave him all of it. Naropa threw the gold up into the air and said, "The whole world is gold to me." At that point Marpa realized the nature of reality more vividly than ever before.
