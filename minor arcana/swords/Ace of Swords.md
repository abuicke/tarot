### Upright

1) A new way of thinking, especially one which expands a person's purview. A higher perspective<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup> (or level of consciousness) has been reached, and as such, the light (of one's consciousness) casts its boundaries further out than it previously could.
2) An increased broadness and openness in one's perspective. A person's perspective encapsulates more than it did before.
3) A strong, clear perspective, which penetrates through matters quickly and easily, not giving way to emotional upset or volatility.
4) Enhanced perceptual abilities
5) Mental acuity
6) Mental peace and clarity
7) Heightened awareness; clarity through meditation.
8) Perfect insight, complete clarity in perception (offering a new, unique persective—genius, wisdom).
9) Fresh perspective
10) Profound insight or realisation



### Reversed

1) False seeing, a false sense of spiritual elevation and clarity; *Luciferic* spiritual insight.
