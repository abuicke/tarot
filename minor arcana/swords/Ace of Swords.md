### Upright

1) A new way of thinking, especially one which expands a person's purview. A higher perspective<sup>1</sup> (or level of consciousness) has been reached, and as such, the light (of one's consciousness) casts its boundaries further out than it previously could. This leads to a sense that one has a higher vantage point than before; their new perspective encapsulates everything previously known, plus what is newly seen.
2) An increased broadness and openness in one's perspective. A person's perspective encapsulates more than it did before.
