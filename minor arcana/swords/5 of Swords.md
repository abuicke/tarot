# 5 of Swords

### Upright

1) **Negative thinking**

Paranoid, panicked, fearful thinking. Although not overwhelming as in the 8 of Swords, or despondent like the 7, and also not emotionally painful like the 5 of Cups. The thinking is negative and paranoid without being in clear connection with an embodied feeling. Perhaps this arises from triggering a thought complex in the psycheâ€”negative thoughts that have become associated through past negative feelings, but now are simply triggered on their own, inducing the negative thinking without the accompanying emotional state. Potentially brought on by tiredness or hunger, but no actual feelings of anxiety or fear in the moment.
