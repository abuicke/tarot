Key Word: Anguish

I don't know how to put it into clear words, but I received this card in the #1 position for a week I was fasting. It was a very good week and not difficult to get through, but I was in physical discomfort for a lot of it. Not sure why I got this card. I thought it was a harsher card than that.
