Every 5 in the thoth tarot shows an averse pentagram. What is this trying to represent? Is it because pain leads us into matter? 

>The central wand has become as heavy as lead. The winged disk which normally would indicate an upward swing into higher spheres now bears a star pointed downward. The center of the star is covered by five small overlapping disks. The eye of Horus has lost its clarity of vision. - Tarot Mirror of the Soul

The 2's represent the inseminating idea of the suit? In the 2 of Wands we have the purest expression of Will, which is the bursting fourth of raw, creative energy. In the 2 of Cups we have Love, the most fundamental idea of water. In the 2 of Swords we have peace which I find more difficult to reconcile; but then in the 2 of Disks we have *Change*, the continual shifting and churning of the the matieral universe.
