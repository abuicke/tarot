### Personality

Confident and powerful. Steadfast in his movements. Assured of his direction, knowing he has exactly what he needs to accomplish his plans. He is both powerful and seamless. He shines light where there wasn't light before. He is God illuminating our mind, giving us absolute certainty of our direction and illuminating our path as we go. The brightness and the light, and the steadfastness and sureness of his direction are the key qualities of this card. His muscles are slender but toned, like a Spartan III compared to a Spartan II.

>*Man has another lotus flower, the one with the twelve leaves. It has its seat in the region of the heart. Once only six leaves were visible. The acquisition of six virtues will bring the six other leaves to unfold in the future. These six virtues are: Thought control, initiative power, mental balance, positivity that allows one to see the best side of every thing, a mind free of prejudice, and finally, harmony of the soul's life.*
