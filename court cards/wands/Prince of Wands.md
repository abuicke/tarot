Confident and powerful. Steadfast in his movements. Assured of his direction, knowing he has exactly what he needs to accomplish his plans. He is both powerful and seamless. He shines light where there wasn't light before. He is God illuminating our mind, giving us absolute certainty of our direction and illuminating our path as we go. The brightness and the light, and the steadfastness and sureness of his direction are the key qualities of this card.
