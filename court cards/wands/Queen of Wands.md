### Footnotes

1. This card appeared in *my influence* in a Celtic Cross reading during a week when I was very focused on the principle of Shakti, and even turned a dancing meditation into a spontaneous invocation of her. The effects were energy, stability of mood, pleasant and euphoric sensations (even in response to things that were usually painful like cold showers).
