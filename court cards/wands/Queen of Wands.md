### Upright

1) Self-knowledge
2) Magical invocation, especially of a female deity, especially an invocation which exerts an influence over elemental water.

This card appeared in *my influence* in a Celtic Cross reading during a week when I turned a dancing meditation into a spontaneous invocation of Shakti. The effects were energy, stability of mood, pleasant and euphoric sensations (even in response to things that were usually painful like cold showers). In this way the water principle (element) was catalysed within me and made harmonious (see *6 of Cups*). For this reason I believe the Queen of Wands relates to this specific type of magical invocation, one connected with Binah (Shakti) and with the water principle (Queen).
