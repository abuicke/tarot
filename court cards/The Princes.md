# The Princes

Chesed is always in the shadow of each prince.

This is because the opposites of nature are made up of the balance between Geburah (each prince's failure) and Tiphareth (his success).

>*Each act of man is the twist and double of an hare. Love and death are the greyhounds that course him. God bred the hounds and taketh His pleasure in the sport.* - **The Book of Lies** by Aleister Crowley

Geburah constantly breaks the order of Chesed, and in the perpetual cycle of Geburah breaking Chesed and Chesed trying to restore its order, we get the beautiful, perfectly balanced (Lamed), harmonious dynamism of Tiphareth.

I can't explain the vision that I see in my mind except to say that if you imagine some *perfectly balanced* (Lamed, Adjustment) system (what occurs to me is a sphere suspended in space in neutral gravity, perhaps with a weight on the bottom so it's always trying to reach an equilibrium), then as soon as you knock it out of place or take a chunk out of it, it now needs to correct itself to maintain its original order. If these disturbances come hard and fast, never ceasing, then what you will get is the beautiful, self-correcting dynamism of Tiphareth. In Tiphareth everything is tending towards a perfect order, and is in fact energetically neutral, but through never being allowed to rest it creates an intense dynamism. Like many many many millions of magnets all suspended together. The total force at play is zero, because there's exactly as many negative poles as there are positive ones, but in reality they will never come to rest and will be constantly in motion. Chesed is like the magnets which have been allowed to come to rest (see any of the fours and you will see they will evoke this idea of a stationary, balanced structure—a square), whereas Tiphareth are the magnets which are never allowed to rest, constantly perturbed, so that they are always seeking their original structure but are actually something much more as a result of this.

This also makes me think of the meaning of The Hermit on the Tree. He is the bringer of the light through the cold wilderness (Chesed). He is responsible for the manifestation of the light (Kether) below the Abyss (as actual light—Tiphareth). It is only through the support of Chesed and Geburah, that Tiphareth is able to embody the wisdom and beauty of Kether below the Abyss, in the world of opposites (The Lovers), in the world of mind (Zayin).

Geburah knows what to cut from Chesed every moment through his hidden Mother across the Abyss, Binah. Binah holds in her the sacred geometry of creation, the exact *proportions* (because Binah is not literal, but abstract, not dealing in concrete figures) through which her lover (Chokmah) is made up (without his knowing, for he cannot reflect on himself, only his bride can know him and ***Understand*** him) and which Chesed has not inherited from his father, for only the Mother and her son Geburah knows this about him. This is why the path which connects Geburah and Binah is Cheth (a boundary, or enclosure—think again how each geometric shape is just such a thing).

The Prince of Wands shadow is in Cups.
The Prince of Cups shadow is in Swords.
The Prince of Swords shadow is in Disks.
The Prince of Disks shadow is in Wands.

In this way I understand the necessity for the court cards. They are describing the relationship between various parts of the Tree, specifically how one pillar relates to another. They are describing a higher-order activity which is occurring, beyond the paths or the sephiroth; moving onto a specific function the tree has (centered around balancing opposites).
