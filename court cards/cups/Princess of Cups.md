### Upright

1) Faith in self. Trusting one's own feelings and intuitions.
2) A peaceful clarity and trust in your own intuition. Self-assured (faith) everything will work out.
3) A fundamentally joyous, rich quality is added to emotion. Feelings themselves are sweeter, and simple things, even doing nothing, has a sweetness to it. Essentially what is experienced when a person takes ecstasy (although not as overpowering). A positive outlook and lack of stress naturally arises from this.
