### PERSONALITY ###

A person who is very self-confident, and for good reason. This is a person who can astutely identify the causal mechanics giving rise to a situation, and can follow that understanding up with an effective plan to practically execute on this knowledge. They are very individualistic, and they should be, because they can do a lot better by themselves than when shankled to a preordained idealogy or way of doing things.
