### Upright

This card represents mental activity, the imaginative activities of the mind which can either dominate and waste energy in many meanignless directions, or be utilised to shape a clear, multi-faceted vision. It all depends on one's ability to let go of, *cut away* (the sword<sup>1</sup>), whatever thoughts are not useful, and combine those that are into a single unifying idea (the prism).

>The figure of this Prince is clothed with closely woven armour adorned with definite device, and the chariot which bears him suggests (even more closely) geometrical ideas. This chariot is drawn by winged children, looking and leaping irresponsibly in any direction that takes their fancy; they are not reined, but perfectly capricious. The chariot consequently is easy enough to move, but quite unable to progress in any definite direction except by accident. This is a perfect picture of the Mind.

>**Aleister Crowley**, *The Book of Thoth* (pp. 161-162)

1) Crystalizing a new vision (the prism) for the future, not limited by the past (the children).
2) Cutting, decisive intellect.
3) Trying to establish a clear vision for the future (the prism), despite the noise of the mind (the children).
4) Overthinking  
5) Oscillating between approaches, but then struggling to implement any of them.



### Reversed

1) A person who is losing interest in the fleeting nature of thoughts. Seeing that they come and go like nothing and shouldn't be taken seriously.

### Footnotes

1. Really it is the sickle which he uses to destroy, but because of how the card appears, with the Prince seeming as though he is just about to cut down his children with the sword, I am saying the sword. "In his right hand is a lifted sword wherewith to create, but in his left hand a sickle, so that what he creates he instantly destroys." - **Aleister Crowley**, *The Book of Thoth* (p. 162)
