# Astrological Correspondences of the Court Cards

>12 of these 16 cards correspond to a particular 30° segment of the zodiac: the first two decanates (i.e., the first 20°) of one sign, of the element to which the card’s suit corresponds, and the last decanate (or 10°) of the preceding sign, which is of a contrary element. By this bridging of two signs, the Court Cards are said to bind together the 12 parts of the zodiac.
>The particular sign, in each element, to which a given Court Card is attributed is chosen so that the three Gunas, or characteristics of nature, are balanced in the two signs and the card’s rank. For example, the Knights, which are Cardinal and sulfuric (Rajasic) in nature, each correspond to the last 10° of a Fixed sign and the first 20° of a Mutable sign. The Queens, which are Fixed and salty (Tamasic) in nature, correspond to a Mutable and a Cardinal sign. The Princes, which are Mutable and mercurial (Sattvic), correspond to a Cardinal and a Fixed sign. (As the Knight, Queen, and Prince correspond to the three Gunas, so does the Princess correspond to that prakriti, or “Nature,” of which they are component characteristics.)
>...
>The Princesses rule fourth-parts of the celestial heavens that lie immediately about the North Celestial Pole, above the respective Kerubic (Fixed or Hub) signs of the zodiac; for example, the Princess of Swords rules the 90° segment centered on the Air Kerubic constellation Aquarius. The Princesses thus form the thrones of the powers of the four Aces, which correspond to the pole. The other 12 Court Cards (the four Knights, Queens, and Princes) rule the dominion of the Celestial Heavens between the realm of the four Princesses and the zodiac, as will be hereafter shown; and they link together the signs.
