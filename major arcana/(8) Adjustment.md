# (VIII) Adjustment

**Key Word:** Truth  
**Song:**   
**Hexagrams:** 42. Yi (Increase/Augment), 61. Chung Fu (Inner Truth)



### Upright

1) **Guided from within** - not being cast about by external circumstances. Think of a perfectly balanced gyroscope ([Bender carrying nitroglycerin soufflé](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ztF8lqZjHI)).
2) **Regaining your center**, regaining a sense of stability and self-ownership.
3) **Seeing that your reactions come from inside of you**, they are not forced on you by the outside world.<sup>1,2</sup>



### Reversed

1) **Off balance**, not your normal self.
2) **Focusing on external control** instead of internal equanimity
3) **Loss of center**, disorientation due to loss of one's fundamental guiding principal.



### Extra

>When you are angry, everything feels unjust, you know, isn't it? Every small thing you think some great injustice is happening to you when you are angry.<sup>3</sup>
