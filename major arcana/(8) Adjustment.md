# (VIII) Adjustment

#### Key Word:  
#### Hexagrams: 42, Yi (Increase/Augment); 61, Chung Fu (Inner Truth) 



### Upright

1) Guided from within - not being cast about by external circumstances. Think of a perfectly balanced gyroscope ([Bender carrying nitroglycerin soufflÃ©](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ztF8lqZjHI)).



### Reversed

1) Off balance, not your normal self.
2) Focusing on external control instead of internal equanimity



### Extra

>*When you are angry, everything feels unjust, you know, isn't it? Every small thing you think some great injustice is happening to you when you are angry.* - [Sadhguru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv-aai4rw5I&t=411s)
