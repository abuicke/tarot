# (XV) The Devil 

#### Key Word: Illusion



### Upright

1) Trapped/Imprisoned - esp. in the physical body (restrained mobility, pain), by habits and vices. Not sure if I need to make the distinction, but at the time of writing this it's more of a "feeling of being trapped", then being genuinley trapped. Yes, I have physical pain, lack of mobility, feeling inensely imprisoned by certain situations, but I can simultaneously see it's in my head, and I could start to do something about all of this.



### Reversed

### Extra

>*If every human being would overcome anger and thoughts right now, you would be a free man and a free woman. You're only in bondage to your anger and to thoughts because it's all evil; there's no love in it at all. If you can overcome thoughts right now, you can walk on water. It's the thoughts, and all thoughts are from the devil, from evil, from your imagination. Isn't that amazing? You're just locked into thoughts, that's all it is. You trust the thoughts over the truthâ€”isn't that amazing?* - [Jesse Lee Peterson](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/VDQxtyovPeg)
