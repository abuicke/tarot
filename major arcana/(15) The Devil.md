# (XV) The Devil 

#### Key Word:



### Upright

1) Trapped/Imprisoned - esp. in the physical body (restrained mobility, pain), by habits and vices. Not sure if I need to make the distinction, but at the time of writing this it's more of a "feeling of being trapped", then being genuinley trapped. Yes, I have physical pain, lack of mobility, feeling inensely imprisoned by certain situations, but I can simultaneously see it's in my head, and I could start to do something about all of this.



### Reversed

1) 



### Extra
