>Secular science or Positivism has busied itself with the investigation of matter and the visible universe as perceived through the five senses. It affirms that by a study of phenomena we are able to approach to the world as it really is, to the things-in-themselves. It is that system which affirms that apprehension is only a name for a certain series of biological and chemical changes occurring in certain of the contents of our material skulls, and that by an investigation of things as they appear to be we can come to an understanding of their causes, what they really are.

>Through Tarot’s history, this Trump was usually called The World, though “world” was understood to mean “universe,” in the sense of the Latin *mundus*. That is, it means “all that there is,” and should not be delimited by time or space. *Mundus* has an unexpected history, which is worth symbolic reflection: As an ancient Mediterranean (probably Etruscan) root, it means a woman’s cosmetics! (The world – all that is – was anciently equated to a woman’s cosmetics.) Furthermore, the equivalent Greek word, *kosmos*, means both the universe and feminine adornment. This lends extraordinary insight into the design of the card and its symbolic meaning!

### Footnotes

1. This hexagram strongly correlates with the meaning of Saturn, and of Binah, on the Tree of Life. "Limitation" is also the name I have given to Binah in the Plain English Qabalah.
