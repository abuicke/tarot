>*People who are unconscious always create unconsciousness, and in this way they influence others; they can get them into an unconscious condition so that they will behave exactly according to their intention. That is the real essence of witchcraft.* **Visions: Notes of the Seminar Given in 1930-1934, Vol. II, pp. 1272-73** by Carl Jung
