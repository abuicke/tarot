The triangles represent the interaction and union of the masculine (Shiva) and feminine (Shakti) divine principles. This is Chokmah (Shiva) and Shakti (Binah) coming together to create Tiphareth via the path of Zayin. This is the creation of opposites giving rise to manifestiation, which requires opposites to exist.
