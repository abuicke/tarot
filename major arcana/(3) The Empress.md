### Footnotes

1. I'm trying to convey a general murkiness. The situation has become unnatractive on every levelâ€”ugly thoughts, ugly mood, ugly feelings, ugly habits, poor hygiene. It's the ugliness and spiritual grime that accompanies depression. A feeling of being low-vibration, energetically heavy and unclean.
