### Upright

1) 



### Reversed

1) Ill health, lethargy, grossness, slothfulness, low-energy, layabout, lack of self-care (hygiene, healthy choices), bad mood, negative thinking (depression resulting therefrom)<sup>1</sup>



### Extra

Parvati is the gentle and nurturing aspect of Shakti, often portrayed as the loving and devoted wife of Shiva (Chokmah). She represents fertility, love, beauty, and devotion. As a mother goddess, she is also known as Annapurna, the goddess of nourishment.



### Footnotes

1. I'm trying to convey a general murkiness. The situation has become unnatractive on every levelâ€”ugly thoughts, ugly mood, ugly feelings, ugly habits, poor hygiene. It's the ugliness and spiritual grime that accompanies depression. A feeling of being low-vibration, energetically heavy and unclean. Essentially, the person or situation is not being nourished in the correct things.
