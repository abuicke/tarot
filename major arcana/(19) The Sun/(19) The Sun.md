### Extra

>Human life on earth is conditioned and unfree, and when man recognizes this limitation and makes himself dependent upon the harmonious and beneficent forces of the cosmos, he achieves success.
>
>*The Book of Changes* (3rd Edition, pp. 293-94)

>May everyone...be encouraged and inspired to light his own candle of inner vision and begin his journey into the boundless space that lies within himself. Then, through realization of his true identity, each student can become a lamp unto his own path. And more. Awareness of the Truth of his being will rip asunder the veil of unknowing that has heretofore enshrouded the star he already is, permitting the brilliance of his light to illumine the darkness of that part of the Universe in which he abides.
>
>**Israel Regardie**, *A Garden Pomegranates* (3rd Edition, p. xxv)

>One thing at a time. In fact, in your whole life, you are doing only one thing at a time. If you can be fully present with one thing at a time, you will be like the sun and manage so much. What overwhelms you are the thoughts of other things to be done, which keep you from being present.
>
>If your life is only about being in this moment, it becomes so expansive. However, we tend to think of efficiency as a linear process, not like the sun expanding in every direction by being present. The linear mind accomplishes very little, and you might think, "Oh, I'm doing so much, I'm working so much, there's so much to do."
>
>The sun doesn't think about where it's going; it just keeps shining by being in one place.
>
>**Satya Ji**, [*Just One Thing At A Time*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwBXUYFn8Qo)

>I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
>
>*John 8:12 (KJV)*
