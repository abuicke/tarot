# (VI) The Lovers

**Key Word:** Relationships  
**Song:** [Empty Cans by The Streets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2i0Nw3NDBU)  
**Hexagrams:** 31. Hsien / Influence (Wooing)



### Upright

1) Choices, **opposites**<sup>1,2</sup>
3) A **relationship** (whether good or bad)
4) The **attraction** between two opposing forces
5) Feeling drawn to an ex-partner.



### Reversed

1) Issues with relationships
2) Lack of communication between friends, feeling isolated.
3) Growing distance between you and others, realising one's relationships aren't as close as previously hoped.



### Extras

#### Shiva and Shakti

The triangles represent the interaction and union of the masculine (Shiva) and feminine (Shakti) divine principles. This is Chokmah (Shiva) and Binah (Shakti) coming together to create Tiphareth (Ganesha) (via the path of Zayin<sup>3</sup>). This is the creation of opposites giving rise to manifestation. It is worth remembering that a triangle is the symbol of Binah.

If one looks at the image, it can be seen through intimation and intuition how the manifest arises from the unmanifest, by a process of constant mirroring. The centre point is the numinous, out of which that which is manifest appears by the path of Zayin. You can see in this particular Sri Yantra that the four elements are also represented by the four gates emerging from the circle.
