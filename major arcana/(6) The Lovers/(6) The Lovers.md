**Key Word:** Relationships  
**Song:** [Empty Cans by The Streets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2i0Nw3NDBU)  
**Hexagrams:** 31. Hsien / Influence (Wooing)



### Upright

1) Choices, **opposites**<sup>1,2</sup>.
3) A **relationship** (whether good or bad)
4) The **attraction** between two opposing forces
5) Feeling drawn to an ex-partner.



### Reversed

1) Issues with relationships
2) Lack of communication between friends, feeling isolated.
3) Growing distance between you and others, realising one's relationships aren't as close as previously hoped.

#### Shiva and Shakti

The triangles<sup>3</sup> represent the interaction of the masculine (Shiva) and feminine (Shakti) principles. This is Chokmah (Shiva) and Binah (Shakti) coming together to create Tiphareth (Ganesha) via the path of Zayin<sup>4</sup>. This is the creation of **opposites**, giving rise to manifestation.

If one looks at the image above, it can be seen through intimation and intuition how the manifest arises from the unmanifest, by a process of constant mirroring<sup>5</sup>. At the centre is an inverted triangle, the Yoni, concealing<sup>6</sup> the numinous, out of which the manifest appears by the path of Zayin. You can see in this particular Sri Yantra that the four elements are represented by the four gates emerging from the circle.

#### Consciousness vs Awareness

### Footnotes

1. [Alan Watts Explains What Awakening Means](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g92i9ilnqfA)
2. It's interesting to note the link between "opposites" and "relationships" (see footnote above).
3. The triangle is the symbol of Binah
4. "Zayin" is the Hebrew word for "sword". Notice the sword blades in the background of this card.
5. See: Queen of Cups. Although Water (Binah) as a whole is a mirror.
6. "Every womanâ€™s body contains a cell of archaic night, where all knowing must stop. This is the profound meaning behind striptease, a sacred dance of pagan origins which, like prostitution, Christianity has never been able to stamp out. Erotic dancing by males cannot be comparable, for a nude woman carries off the stage a final concealment, that chthonian darkness from which we come." - **Camille Paglia**, *Sexual Personae* (Yale University Press, 2001), pp. 22-23
7. Tiphareth
8. Chokmah
