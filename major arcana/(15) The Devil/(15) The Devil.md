# (XV) The Devil 

**Key Word:** Illusion (Maya)  
**Song:** [Suicidal Thoughts by The Notorious B.I.G.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1mKGlYL9jg)  
**Hexagrams:** 29. K'an / The Abysmal (Water)



### Upright

1) **Trapped/Imprisoned**<sup>1</sup>—especially in the physical body (restrained mobility, pain).
2) Hampered by physical limitation.



### Reversed

1) Freedom from bondage. Whatever has been oppressing a person, making them feel like a prisoner, is gone.



### Extra

>If every human being would overcome anger and thoughts right now, you would be a free man and a free woman. You're only in bondage to your anger and to thoughts, because it's all evil; there's no love in it at all. If you can overcome thoughts right now, you can walk on water. It's the thoughts, and all thoughts are from the devil, from evil, from your imagination. Isn't that amazing? You're just locked into thoughts, that's all it is. You trust the thoughts over the truth—isn't that amazing?

### Footnotes

1. The level to which one is actually restricted may be quite different from the degree to which *they feel* they are. The sense of imprisonment may be self-imposed (psychological) in nature.
