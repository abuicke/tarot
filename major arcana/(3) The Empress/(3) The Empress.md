### Upright

1) Love, the love of a partner (a woman).
2) The sensual aspects of life, fragrance, food, fashion, beauty, music<sup>2</sup>, colour, aesthetics.
3) The feminine principle<sup>3</sup>, life for life's sake, that which is beautiful in the world.

4. I'm trying to convey a general murkiness. The situation has become unattractive on every levelâ€”ugly thoughts, ugly mood, ugly feelings, ugly habits, poor hygiene. It's the ugliness and spiritual grime that accompanies depression. A feeling of being low-vibration, energetically heavy and unclean. Essentially, the person or situation is not being nourished in the correct things.
