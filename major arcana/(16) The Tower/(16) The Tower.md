### Footnotes

1. "The dark lines are about to mount upward and overthrow the last firm, light line by exerting a disintegrating influence on it. The inferior, dark forces overcome what is superior and strong, not by direct means, but by undermining it gradually and imperceptibly, so that it finally collapses. The lines of the hexagram present the image of a house, the top line being the roof, and because the roof is being shattered the house collapses." - *The I Ching or Book of Changes* (Princeton University Press, 1983), p. 250
2. "Force meets Form, especially the influx of unbounded Vital Force into mental structures, either to invigorate or shatter them." - *Liber Theta* (College of Thelema, 2012), p. 29
3. This is the process of integration. By feeling and *understanding* painful emotions, they are processed and become part of us (*wisdom*), no longer exerting influence over us subconsciously. This is why, in the sequence of the Tarot, the chaotic tumult of The Tower is followed by the beautiful, peaceful serenity of The Star (Chokmah). Imagine a harrowing battle giving way to a peaceful night sky.
