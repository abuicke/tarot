**Hexagrams:** 39. Chien / Obstruction



### Upright

1) **Release**
2) **Giving up**. Seeing that no more progress can be made in the current state or situation.
3) Reaching an **impasse**.
4) (Being) **stuck**, a situation that can't progress in it's current form.
5) Achieving a new perspective as the result of being stuck. Forced to pay attention as the result of immobility.



### Reversed

1) Trusting in one's own intuition again.
2) Being liberated from one's own narrow-mindedness and limited purview.
3) Aligning one's self with God's plan instead of one's own plans.
4) Full surrender to the Higher Self.
