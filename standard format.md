### Upright

1) **Guided from within** - not being cast about by external circumstances. Think of a perfectly balanced gyroscope ([Bender carrying nitroglycerin soufflé](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ztF8lqZjHI)).
2) **Regaining your centre**, regaining a sense of stability and self-ownership.
3) Seeing that your reactions come from inside of you, they are not forced on you by the outside world.<sup>1,2</sup>



### Reversed

1) Off balance, not your normal self.
2) Focusing on external control instead of internal equanimity.
3) **Loss of centre**, disorientation due to loss of one's fundamental guiding principal.
