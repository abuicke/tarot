# Geburah

Geburah is most aplty described by the Second Law of Thermodynamics, it exists in permanent competition with the tireless Chesed to maintain boundaries (Cheth) and order within manifestion. Gevurah's continuous movement, moving from hot to cold, positive to negatice, high to low, is what creates the force, energy and activity in nature. Therefore, without Chesed's continuous drive towards ever increasing entropy, the very momentum of existence would come to a halt in Geburah. It is only by its constant efforts to restore order in the ever-expanding kingdom of Chesed, that we get the beautiful, harmonious dynamism of Tiphareth.

In this way, all the 5's in the Tarot are related to some kind pain or severity, but it should equally be taken with hope that this is the corrective nature of reality at work. Without the pain of Geburah to restore order when entropy becomes too much, we would very quickly become overhwhelmed by excess, not to mention this corrective action is what gives us our energy, our propulsion, our will. The only mistake that can be made when dealing with Geburah is to try to hold onto that which must be let go of.
