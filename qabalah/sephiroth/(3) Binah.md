# Binah

Binah is intuition, because Shakti is the underlying principle of everything. If you understand her, you understand everything around you, simply by feel.<sup>1</sup>

>In human life too the individual achieves significance through discrimination and the setting of limits<sup>2</sup>. Therefore what concerns us here is the problem of clearly defining these discriminations, which are, so to speak, the backbone of morality. Unlimited possibilities are not suited to man; if they existed, his life would only dissolve in the boundless. To become strong, a man’s life needs the limitations ordained by duty and voluntarily accepted. The individual attains significance as a free spirit only by surrounding himself with these limitations and by determining for himself what his duty is.
