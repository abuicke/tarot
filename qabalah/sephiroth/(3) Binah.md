# Binah

Binah is the universal blueprint, the underlying geometric harmony of nature itself. Mathematicians and musicians alike have frequently touched upon this underlying fabric of Being—$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$, the Phi ratio and Einstein's general relativity are all examples of this. For this reason, Binah is our intuition. When we touch it, we experience flashes of direct knowing—as we glimpse the perfection of the Whole in single moment of divine insight. When we contact Binah, we glimpse reality at the most fundamental level, it's underlying architecture, as opposed to myriad shapes and forms that arise from it (*Zayin*).

It is this blueprint and pristine geometry which informs its enforcer—Geburah—of what to *cut away*, to maintain the proper "shape" and proportions of Manifest Being. This is necessary to manage the overzealous growth inherent in Chesed, and gives rise to the perfect living and dying harmony of Tiphareth.

Binah is intuition, because Shakti is the underlying principle of everything. If you understand her, you understand everything around you, simply by feel.<sup>1</sup>

>In human life too the individual achieves significance through discrimination and the setting of limits<sup>2</sup>. Therefore what concerns us here is the problem of clearly defining these discriminations, which are, so to speak, the backbone of morality. Unlimited possibilities are not suited to man; if they existed, his life would only dissolve in the boundless. To become strong, a man’s life needs the limitations ordained by duty and voluntarily accepted. The individual attains significance as a free spirit only by surrounding himself with these limitations and by determining for himself what his duty is.
