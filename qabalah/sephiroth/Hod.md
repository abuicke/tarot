>If you think it's worth one minute, one minute. If you think it's one hour, one hour. If you think it's worth 24 hours, 24 hours. Whatever you see, one who is only watching the reflections of his mindâ€”nothing will change. Endless cycles will go on, but nothing will change, because nothing changes on the mirror. Whose face is being reflected right now will not change the quality of the mirror in any way. Who is behind the mirror? If we know who is behind the mirror, then we can change everything. Then we can even make the mirror turn around and turn inward completely.
