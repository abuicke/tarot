# Malkuth

>Malkuth...represents the final issue of the Energy. Here is great and final solidification. The force is completely expended and results in death.

Malkuth is the death of each suit. In Malkuth, the suit has done its job too well and degenerates into its dullest nature (even fracturing into four elements<sup>1</sup>); Wands become Oppression<sup>2</sup>, Cups become Satiety, Swords become Ruin, however, Disks become Wealth, as there is an opportunity for renewal<sup>3</sup> in the 10 of Disks.

>The Ten of Disks is called Wealth. Here again is written this constantly recurring doctrine, that as soon as one gets to the bottom one finds oneself at the top; and Wealth is given to Mercury in Virgo. When wealth accumulates beyond a certain point, it must either become completely inert and cease to be wealth, or call in the aid of intelligence to use it rightly. This must necessarily happen in spheres which have nothing whatever to do with material possessions, as such. In this way, Carnegie establishes a Library, Rockefeller endows Research, simply because there is nothing else to do. But all this doctrine lies behind the card; it is the inner meaning of the card.
