# MBTI

MBTI is a system of Jungian personality typology which is of great import to the learning of the Tarot and to the understanding one's own nature.


## The Functions

**Intuition** - *The capacity to perceive what is not there.* Intuition allows an individual to have a much broader grasp of a situation or concept, going far beyond Sensation, because unlike Sensation, Intuition is willing to accept fuzziness and missing data as part of its picture. Given that the mind has only limited resources with which to perceive and process information, a choice must be made between processing a small amount of very high-resolution information<sup>1</sup> (Sensation, what is actually there), or a large amount of low-resolution informationâ€”a scattering of data points with an implied, but unexpressed correlation between them. This is the genius of the Intuitive function. It can sense when data, events and phenomenon are correlated without being able to explicitly say why in the moment. To have an understanding of *why* requires the support of the functions to fill in the details.
