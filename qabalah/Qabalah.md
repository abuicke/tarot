## The Elements & The Four Worlds

Fire/Atziluth - Creating, Generating, Inseminating (Creation)  
Water/Briah - Grasping, Understanding, Knowing (Intuition)  
Air/Yetzirah - Dissecting, Examining, Categorizing (Mentation)  
Earth/Assiah - Embodying, Being, Doing, (Crystallization)  


## Fire/Light/Yang ðŸ”¥
>The fundamental attributes of the Fiery principle are heat and expansion - **Franz Bardon**, *Initiation Into Hermetics*


## Water/Darkness/Yin ðŸ’§
The fundamental attributes of the Watery principle are coldness and contraction.


## Air ðŸ’¨
>In its position as a mediator, the Airy principle has acquired from Fire the attribute of warmth and from Water the attribute of moisture - **Franz Bardon**, *Initiation Into Hermetics*

According to Bardon, this is a virtual element. It comes about only as the interaction between the real elements of Fire and Water.


## Earth ðŸŒ±
The Earth element adopts the remaining two qualities of Fire and Water not taken up by Air, being dryness and coolness. Like Air, it is also a virtual element, but one which itself houses all the other elements within its form.<sup>1</sup> It is created out of the interaction between Fire, Water and Air; and through it's consolidating action brings them into the world of physical matter. It is therefore responsible for the existence of the elements on the material plane as the earth, air, water and fire of everyday life.


## The Sephiroth

It is important to note that the Sephiroth do not exist independently, one is built on another. Yesod, for example, has the qualities of each sephirah that came before it, plus its own. It is a worthwhile exercise to find the qualities a sephirah has inherrented from each of its parents, which it will express in its own way.

## Footnotes
1. This is why Malkuth on Tree of Life is drawn with four colours, equally segmented, each one representing one of the four elements on the plane of Earth.
2. From the point of view of the third-eye, seeing and creating are one and the same.
3. See First Law of Thermodynamics (Law of Energy Conservation) 
4. An alternative perspective: [The Parts Of The Soul Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMi-Hyt0Acw)
5. The belief a society has that it will last forever. The feeling a society has that it possesses a divine mandate from God to grow and expand.
