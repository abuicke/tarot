# The Qabalah

Here is discussed the many facets of the Hermetic Qabalah and The Tree of Life.

## The Elements & The Four Worlds

**Fire/Atziluth** - Creating, Generating, Inseminating (Creation)  
**Water/Briah** - Grasping, Understanding, Knowing (Intuition)  
**Air/Yetzirah** - Dissecting, Examining, Categorizing (Mentation)  
**Earth/Assiah** - Embodying, Being, Doing (Crystallization)  


## Fire/Light/Yang 🔥
>The fundamental attributes of the Fiery principle are heat and expansion
>
>**Franz Bardon**, *Initiation Into Hermetics*


## Water/Darkness/Yin 💧
The fundamental attributes of the Watery principle are coldness and contraction.


## Air 💨
>In its position as a mediator, the Airy principle has acquired from Fire the attribute of warmth and from Water the attribute of moisture
>
>**Franz Bardon**, *Initiation Into Hermetics*

According to Bardon, this is a virtual element. It comes about only as the interaction between the real elements of Fire and Water.


## Earth 🌱
The Earth element adopts the remaining two qualities of Fire and Water not taken up by Air, being dryness and coolness. Like Air, it is also a virtual element, but one which itself houses all the other elements within its form.<sup>1</sup> It is created out of the interaction between Fire, Water and Air; and through it's consolidating action brings them into the world of physical matter. It is therefore responsible for the existence of the elements on the material plane as the earth, air, water and fire of everyday life.

## The Sephiroth

Kether - **Being**  
Chokmah - **Creating**, Witnessing<sup>3</sup>  
Binah - **Understanding**, Forming, Limiting  
Chesed - **Expanding**, Establishing, Ordering, Structuring  
Geburah - **Destroying**, Shaping, Bounding  
Tiphareth - **Harmonizing**, Experiencing  
Netzach - **Feeling**, Decomposing  
Hod - **Comprehending**, Reflecting, Channelizing  
Yesod - **Living**, Building, Growing  
Malkuth - **Acting**, Doing  

It is important to note that the Sephiroth do not exist independently, one is built on another. Yesod, for example, has the qualities of each sephirah that came before it, plus its own. It is a worthwhile exercise to find the qualities a sephirah has inherited from each of its parents, which it will express in its own way.


## The Sephiroth (of the macrocosm)

Kether - Brahma  
Chokmah - The Causal Plane, The Great Father, Shiva  
Binah - The Causal Plane, The Great Mother, Shakti, Kali, Sacred Geometry  
Chesed - Karma (as cause), Vishnu, Cosmic Order (upholding the good)  
Geburah - Karma (as effect), Durga, Cosmic Order (destroying the evil, i.e. the entropic—arising from Chesed)  
Tiphareth - The Mental Plane, Christ, Rama (as Maryada Purushottama), Demiourgos<sup>4</sup>  
Netzach - The Astral Plane, Indra, Kama  
Hod - The Astral Plane  
Yesod - The Etheric Plane  
Malkuth - The Physical Plane  

When dealing with Chesed and Geburah, we are really dealing with the aspects of Chokmah and Binah that exert influence below the Abyss, e.g. Shakti is the abstract feminine principle represented by Binah, while Durga is her manifestation below the Abyss in the form of Geburah, the fierce aspect of Shakti that combats evil and restores dharma (cosmic order).


## The Sephiroth (of manifestation)

Kether - Space  
Chokmah - Energy  
Binah - Time<sup>5</sup>, Causality  
Chesed - Entropy  
Geburah - Physics, Force, Conservation<sup>6</sup>  
Tiphareth - Electromagnetic field, Light (invisible)  
Netzach - Electricity, Light (spectrum)  
Hod - Magnetism  
Yesod - Charged Particles  
Malkuth - Matter

There's a quality of Geburah which is "the corrective nature of physics", probably best termed simply as *Physics*, which I have labelled it here. The bounding, limiting, shaping nature of Binah, becomes the violent correcting force of Geburah below the Abyss. It's the fall of an apple due to gravity, it's the flow of electricity from positive to negative, heat from hot to cold. It is the first Law of Thermodynamics.

>This much I do know—that there is a power or a first cause, or an Intelligence which permeates every atom of matter, and embraces every unit of energy perceptible to man; that this Infinite Intelligence converts acorns into oak trees, causes water to flow downhill in response to the law of gravity, follows night with day, and winter with summer, each maintaining its proper place and relationship to the other. This Intelligence may aid in transmuting one's desires into concrete or material form. I have this knowledge because I have experimented with it and have experienced it.
>
>**Napoleon Hill**, *Outwitting The Devil*, pp. 48-49

>“Do what thou wilt…” is to bid Stars to shine, Vines to bear grapes, Water to seek its level; man is the only being in Nature that has striven to set himself at odds with himself.
>
>**Aleister Crowley**, *Book 4, Part III: Magick in Theory and Practice*, p. 241

Yesod - **Drives**, Impulses, Compulsions, Memory (as retained impressions, samskaras)

### Qlipoth

Kether -   
Chokmah -   
Binah -   
Chesed - Mania  
Geburah - Cruelty  
Tiphareth - Fanaticism (Ideological Possession)  
Netzach - Gluttony  
Hod - Narcissism  
Yesod - Hedonism  
Malkuth - Suicide

It should be noted that terms such as *Joy* and *Pain* do not only refer to human emotions; they are fundamental qualities of the cosmos and of human experience. Joy is the experience of expanding and growing, Pain is the experience of contracting and disintegrating. These things can be experienced at different levels, such as in emotion (Netzach), thought (Hod) or instinctual drives (Yesod); but they exist as independent principles.

The qualities attributed to Yesod of the human experience have the nature of a strong, magnetic attraction. Drives, impulses and compulsions feel as though a person is electrically charged, feeling an overwhelming draw towards the object of their attraction (sexual attraction being the most powerful, and the quintessence of this sphere). This can also manifest as the opposite, a powerful revulsion and aversion to whatever is not desired. The samskaras are then the retained impressions of these experiences. It is not surprising then that the etheric body, which correlates to Yesod, is the "electric body". Yesod is also associated with the reproductive organs and sexual attraction. It is therefore also not surprising that if one pays attention to the feelings of sexual arousal, it has a distinct electrical/magnetic sensation, as though the person has become "charged up" and is drawn to the object of their desire almost by a physical force of magnetic attraction. This etheric/electric body is also how trauma is "stored in the body", impressions left by past experiences which have the ability to replay as painful aversions at any moment.

### The Plain English Paths

**Zayin - Choices**  
>Consciousness is awareness with choices
>
>**Tom Campbell**

**Cheth - Boundaries**

**Nun - Decomposition, Change, Imagination**  
Call to mind the image of pure invisible "white" light coming apart into the colour spectrum. These are all the emotions, all the gods of antiquity. They quite literally "colour" our consciousness (Tiphareth), so as to emphasise one aspect and hide its opposite, exactly as a coloured lens does. In a single moment, one person can become our enemy (coloured by anger) and another can appear to us as the love of our life (coloured by lust and fantasy).

### The Abyss and the Triads

**The Supernal Triad and the Moral Triad**  
Below the Abyss, the Infinity of Chokmah becomes Expansion, in its manifest counterpart of Chesed; the Eternity of Kether becomes Cyclicity<sup>10</sup>, in its manifest counterpart of Tiphareth; and the Limiting nature of Binah, becomes the corrective enforcement of Geburah. However, Chesed also inherits qualities of structure from Binah; and Geburah manifests Chokmah's energy as force.

## Footnotes
1. This is why Malkuth on Tree of Life is drawn with four colours, equally segmented, each one representing one of the four elements on the plane of Earth.
2. Based on [*3 basic qualities of existence: Tamas, Rajas and Satva*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsklzXQN27M) by Sadhguru
3. From the point of view of the third-eye, seeing and creating are one and the same.
4. "Demiourgos is Greek for 'public worker'. In Platonism and Gnosticism this term is used to describe a subordinate god who creates and arranges the physical world [Tiphareth] to make it conform to a rational eternal ideal [Kether]." - *A Garden of Pomegranates* (3rd Edition), p. 13
5. Time is just another way of representing energy, it is its inversion. Time is a function of energy, the amount of energy something has is reflected in the amount of time it lasts.
6. See First Law of Thermodynamics (Law of Energy Conservation) 
7. "Consciousness is awareness with choices" - Tom Campbell (See: The Lovers)
8. An alternative perspective: [The Parts Of The Soul Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMi-Hyt0Acw)
9. The belief a society has that it will last forever. The feeling a society has that it possesses a divine mandate from God to grow and expand.
