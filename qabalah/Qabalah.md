## The Elements & The Four Worlds

**Fire/Atziluth/Spiritual** - Creating, Generating, Inseminating (Creation)  
**Water/Briah/Moral** - Grasping, Understanding, Knowing (Intuition)  
**Air/Yetzirah/Intellectual** - Dissecting, Examining, Categorizing (Mentation)  
**Earth/Assiah/Actual** - Embodying, Being, Doing (Crystallization)  


## Fire/Light/Yang 🔥
>The fundamental attributes of the Fiery principle are heat and expansion
>
>**Franz Bardon**, *Initiation Into Hermetics* (New Leaf, 2016), p. 27


## Water/Darkness/Yin 💧
The fundamental attributes of the Watery principle are coldness and contraction.


## Air 💨
>In its position as a mediator, the Airy principle has acquired from Fire the attribute of warmth and from Water the attribute of moisture.
>
>**Franz Bardon**, *Initiation Into Hermetics* (New Leaf, 2016), p. 29

According to Bardon, this is a virtual element. It comes about only as the interaction between the real elements of Fire and Water.


## Earth 🌱
The Earth element adopts the remaining two qualities of Fire and Water not taken up by Air, being dryness and coolness. Like Air, it is also a virtual element, but one which itself houses all the other elements within its form.<sup>1</sup> It is created out of the interaction between Fire, Water and Air; and through it's consolidating action brings them into the world of physical matter. It is therefore responsible for the existence of the elements on the material plane as the earth, air, water and fire of everyday life.

## The Sephiroth

Kether - **Being**  
Chokmah - **Creating**, Witnessing<sup>3</sup>  
Binah - **Understanding**, Forming, Limiting  
Chesed - **Expanding**, Establishing, Ordering, Structuring  
Geburah - **Destroying**, Shaping, Bounding  
Tiphareth - **Harmonizing**, Experiencing  
Netzach - **Feeling**, Decomposing  
Hod - **Comprehending**, Reflecting, Channelizing  
Yesod - **Living**, Building, Growing  
Malkuth - **Acting**, Doing  

It is important to note that the Sephiroth do not exist independently, one is built on another. Yesod, for example, has the qualities of each sephirah that came before it, plus its own. It is a worthwhile exercise to find the qualities a sephirah has inherited from each of its parents, which it will express in its own way.

>Yesod...brings the Energy back into balance. [It] represents always the fullest development of the Force in its relation with the Forces above it. The Nine may be considered as the best that can be obtained from the type involved, regarded from a practical and material standpoint.
>
>**Aleister Crowley**, *The Book of Thoth* (Weiser, 2009), pp. 193 - 194


## The Sephiroth (of the macrocosm)

Kether - Brahma  
Chokmah - The Causal Plane, The Great Father, Shiva, Lingam  
Binah - The Causal Plane, The Great Mother, Shakti, Kali, Sacred Geometry, Yoni  
Chesed - Natural Law (Dhamma/Dharma) Karma (as cause), Vishnu, Cosmic Order (upholding the good)  
Geburah - Karma (as effect), Durga, Cosmic Order (destroying the evil, i.e. the entropic—arising from Chesed)  
Tiphareth - The Mental Plane, Christ, Rama (as Maryada Purushottama), Demiourgos<sup>4</sup>  
Netzach - The Astral Plane, Indra, Kama  
Hod - The Astral Plane  
Yesod - The Etheric Plane  
Malkuth - The Physical Plane  

When dealing with Chesed and Geburah, we are really dealing with the aspects of Chokmah and Binah that exert influence below the Abyss, e.g. Shakti is the abstract feminine principle represented by Binah, while Durga is her manifestation below the Abyss in the form of Geburah, the fierce aspect of Shakti that combats evil and restores dharma (cosmic order).


## The Sephiroth (of manifestation)

Kether - Space  
Chokmah - Energy  
Binah - Time<sup>5</sup>, Causality  
Chesed - Entropy  
Geburah - Physics, Force, Conservation<sup>6</sup>  
Tiphareth - Electromagnetic field, Light (invisible)  
Netzach - Electricity, Light (spectrum)  
Hod - Magnetism  
Yesod - Charged Particles  
Malkuth - Matter

There's a quality of Geburah which is "the corrective nature of physics", probably best termed simply as *Physics*, which I have labelled it here. The bounding, limiting, shaping nature of Binah, becomes the violent correcting force of Geburah below the Abyss. It's the fall of an apple due to gravity, it's the flow of electricity from positive to negative, heat from hot to cold. It is the first Law of Thermodynamics.

>This much I do know—that there is a power or a first cause, or an Intelligence which permeates every atom of matter, and embraces every unit of energy perceptible to man; that this Infinite Intelligence converts acorns into oak trees, causes water to flow downhill in response to the law of gravity, follows night with day, and winter with summer, each maintaining its proper place and relationship to the other. This Intelligence may aid in transmuting one's desires into concrete or material form. I have this knowledge because I have experimented with it and have experienced it.
>
>**Napoleon Hill**, *Outwitting The Devil* (Sound Wisdom, 2020), pp. 48-49

>“Do what thou wilt…” is to bid Stars to shine, Vines to bear grapes, Water to seek its level; man is the only being in Nature that has striven to set himself at odds with himself.
>
>**Aleister Crowley**, *Magick in Theory and Practice* (Celephaïs Press, 2019), p. 241

#### Qlipoth (of the human experience)

Geburah - Cruelty  
Tiphareth - Fanaticism (Ideological Possession)  
Netzach - Gluttony  
Hod - Narcissism  
Yesod - Hedonism  
Malkuth - Suicide

It should be noted that terms such as *Joy* and *Pain* do not only refer to human emotions; they are fundamental qualities of the cosmos and of human experience. Joy is the experience of expanding and growing, Pain is the experience of contracting and disintegrating. These things can be experienced spiritually, intellectually, emotionally or physically; but they exist as independent principles.

The qualities attributed to Yesod of the human experience have the nature of an electrical charge on the one hand, and a magnetic push or pull on the other. These are our drives, impulses, compulsions and instinctual responses. They produce a feeling of electricity in the body (nervous system arousal), and either an overwhelming draw towards (Joy), or repulsion away from (Pain), an object or experience. Samskaras are the retained impressions of these experiences in the etheric body, trauma being the retained impressions of negative experiences<sup>8</sup> which continue to exert an influence on the person after the event has passed. It is not surprising that the etheric body, which correlates to Yesod, is the "electric body". Yesod is also associated with the reproductive organs, sexual attraction being a quintessential example of this magnetism and charge.

Binah - Limitation  
Chesed - Expansion  
Geburah - Contraction  
Tiphareth - Cyclicity  
Netzach - Charge  
Hod - Polarization  
Yesod - Stability  
Malkuth - Activity

### The Plain English Paths

**Zayin - Choices**  
>Consciousness is awareness with choices
>
>**Tom Campbell**

**Cheth - Boundaries**

**Nun - Decomposition, Change, Imagination**  
Call to mind the image of pure invisible "white" light coming apart into the colour spectrum. These are all the emotions, all the gods of antiquity. They quite literally "colour" our consciousness (Tiphareth), so as to emphasise one aspect and hide its opposite, exactly as a coloured lens does. In a single moment, one person can become our enemy (coloured by anger) and another can appear to us as the love of our life (coloured by lust and fantasy).

### The Abyss and the Triads

**The Supernal Triad and the Moral Triad**  
Below the Abyss, the Infinity of Chokmah becomes Expansion, in its manifest counterpart of Chesed; the Eternity of Kether becomes Cyclicity<sup>11</sup>, in its manifest counterpart of Tiphareth; and the Limiting nature of Binah, becomes the corrective enforcement of Geburah. However, Chesed also inherits qualities of structure from Binah; and Geburah manifests Chokmah's energy as force.
