# Astrology

The zodiacal signs are the twelve fundamenal archetypes of our solar system. They are the product of the highest spiritual hierarchies (the celestial triad), and their influence is mediated between them and human beings via the planets (the lower hierachies, the moral and the mundane triads). This influence can be clearly seen in a person's natal chart, whereby to channel the influence of a sign into a person's life, a planet must be placed in that sign, creating a specific way in which that archetype manifests in the mundane world.
