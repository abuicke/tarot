# Mundane Triad

The mundane triad is the lowest triad on the Tree of Life, made up of Netzach, Hod and Yesod. It encapsulates the mundane aspects of human experience; our feelings (Netzach), thoughts (Hod) and impulses (Yesod); the aspects of human existence most readily available to the average person, not including Malkuth, i.e. the physical body. 



## Psychology of the Mundane Triad

Thoughts (Hod) come from emotions (Netzach) that *can't be held*<sup>1</sup>.

When you start to have a feeling (Netzach), you will see that as soon as you begin to resist it, or pull away from it, immediately thoughts (Hod) will begin to arise (usually in the form of excuses, or blame)—and a thought held in the mind along with an emotion will create an energy<sup>2</sup>.

The three Buddhist kleshas are the three ways in which we respond to emotions which are not fully owned. We either become avoidant (make an excuse), hostile (blame an external factor) or desirous (fantasize about the object of our desire, believing an external factor will put us at peace).

When a thought is combined with an emotion to become an energy: avoidance and excuse making becomes self-deception and delusion, hostility becomes hatred, and desire becomes perversion.

>If you make it too big, you will become perverted in your thinking; if you try to obliterate it, you will become even more perverted.

If the energy already exists, the thought will be added to a complex of other thoughts, all centered around the same emotion within the the system.

>Because ideas become associated with each other, forming definite complexes, there is, if repressed memories begin to grow by association, a splitting off of one side of the mind at the expense of the other with a consequent locking up of energy and vitality which should be available for the entire personality.

In order to stop a stored up trauma (a memory in the etheric body) from continuously repeating, one must be present with it, and penetrate into the feeling that resides within it. By feeling the emotion that wanted to be felt when the trauma was created, the memory becomes undone and the energy (tension) is released.<sup>3</sup>

Simply by being present throughout the day this can be achieved, as many things will trigger your repressed complexes. Observe when you become uncomfortable, anxious or begin to daydream, and there you know there is an unfelt emotion.

1. "Force meets Form, especially the influx of unbounded Vital Force into mental structures, either to invigorate or shatter them." - *Liber Theta*, (XVI) The Tower
2. Also referred to as a thought-form, or an energy-form. Pay special attention to the word "form" here, and it's connection with Yesod.
3. This tension has its physical correlate in the tense muscles of the body, which store stress in the same way.
