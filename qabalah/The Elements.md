## Water

Water (Binah) is the gateway (the water of life, the water of manifestation in all the creation myths) bringing the goals and desires of Fire (Chokmah, Wands), through the mental models and conceptions of Air (Yetzirah, Swords) into the final form of matter (Earth) in the physical world. Water, the Divine Feminine principle (Binah), orchestrates the entire play of creation. She is the mirror<sup>1,2</sup> of the divine, so that he may know himself<sup>3</sup>, and thus give rise to the entire drama of being through which the *process* (Air, Manifesttion) of His *Understanding* takes place.

1. See: Queen of Cups
2. Chokmah is the face of the Divine. It is the outward facing aspect of Kether, and as such Binah is his mirror (and his consort) which reflects (and gives rise to) all the images and manifestations of Yetzirahâ€”which itself communes with his parents to give rise to Earth (Assiah).
3. "I was a hidden treasure, and I wished to be known, so I created a creation (mankind), then made Myself known to them, and they recognised Me." - *Hadith of the Hidden Treasure*
