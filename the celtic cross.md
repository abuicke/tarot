# The Celtic Cross

The Celtic Cross is a well known ten card tarot spread popularized by A. E. Waite in his *Pictorial Key to the Tarot*<sup>1</sup>. The cards in this spread can be grouped together as follows:

- There are three cards related directly to the situation at hand

	- **1**: the situation as it currently stands
	- **2**: the challenge
	- **10**: the final outcome

- Two cards related to time

	- **5**: the past
	- **6**: the immediate future
	
- Two cards related to perception (the feminine aspect of the reading)

	- **3**: your conscious perception of the situation, the lens through which you're interpreting events; or, what you are consciously focused on
	- **4**: your unconscious perception of the situation, what you don't realise is on your mind, influencing how you're interpreting you're experience

- Two cards related to influence (the masculine aspect of the reading)

	- **7**: your influence, how you are affecting the situation
	- **8**: external influences, how the situation is being influenced outside of your control

- and one card, **9**, which is your hopes and fears. The direction you hope you are going in, or fear you might be heading towards.



## Positions

### 1 - The Current Situation

#### When placing this card down say *This covers me*

The current state of the situation the querent is asking about.

You don't necessarily feel the situation; it's the circumstances that everything else is arising from or happening around and shouldn't implicitly be considered as some future incident that is going to take place. It may be a pre-existing situation that's now having a significant influence, or bears importance to the question being asked.



### 2 - The Challenge/Conflict

#### When placing this card down say *This crosses me*

The change or friction the querent will experience in relation to the situation developing.



### 3 - The Conscious Mind/Attitude

#### When placing this card down say *This crowns me*

The querent's mindset, how you're looking at the world; but it can also be what you're mind is focused on. For example, a person could receive 8 of Swords in this position, which may indicate they're perceptions will be scattered and overwhelming, or it may indicate they are reflecting on a challenge which will have these qualities. Thinking *about* an 8 of Swords type situation as opposed to adopting it as your perspective. 



### 4 - The Unconscious Mind/Attitude

#### When placing this card down say *This is beneath me*

Really the unconscious is what's pushing you forward. It's the unseen motivation that's driving you.

In many cases the unconscious card will be reversed, indicating the lack of a certain quality or state is troubling you and driving you to act.



### 5 - The Past

#### When placing this card down say *This is behind me*



### 6 - The Immediate Future

#### When placing this card down say *This is before me*



### 7 - My Energy/Influence (On the Situation)



### 8 - Outside Energy/Influence (On The Situation)



### 9 - Hopes & Fears



### 10 - The Ultimate Outcome



### 0 - Bottom of the deck

This is the theme of the whole reading. When a card appears in the reverse in this position, it's not necessarily an indication that the negative qualities of that card are the theme of the reading. It could be that the positive qualities of that card are being worked on. For example, The Sun reversed in this position could mean that the theme of the reading is unhappiness, or it could also mean the theme is striving towards happinessâ€”putting right whatever is making you or the situation unhappy.



## Reading for a period of time

The elements of the cross aren't necessarily related causally when reading for a period of time, even though there may be a more subtle, indirect link. For example, the situation, the challenge and the immediate future may all be describing different independent events going on in the same time frame.
