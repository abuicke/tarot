# The Celtic Cross

## Notes

-The elements of the cross aren't necessarily related causally when reading for a period of time, even though there may be a more subtle, indirect link. For example, the situation, the challenge and the immediate future may all be describing different independent events going on in the same time frame.



## Positions


### 1 - The Current Situation

When placing this card down say "This covers me"

-It's important to remember you don't necessarily feel the situation. It's just the circumstances that are creating the context for everything else to happen in/from.



### 2 - The Challenge/Conflict

When placing this card down say "This crosses me"



### 3 - The Concious Attitude

When placing this card down say "This crowns me"



### 4 - The Unconscious

When placing this card down say "This is beneath me"

Really the unconscious is what's pushing you forward. It's the unseen motivation that's driving you.

In many cases the unconscious card will be reversed, indicating the lack of a certain quality or state is troubling you and driving you to act.



### 5 - The Past

When placing this card down say "This is behind me"



### 6 - The Immediate Future

When placing this card down say "This is before me"



### 7 - My Energy/Influence



### 8 - The Outside Energy/Influence



### 9 - Hopes & Fears



### 10 - The Ultimate Outcome
