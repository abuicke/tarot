>All these Wheels be one; yet of all these the Wheel of the TARO alone avails thee consciously.  
>Meditate long and broad and deep, O man, upon this Wheel, revolving it in thy mind.  
>Be this thy task, to see how each card springs necessarily from each other card, even in due order from The Fool unto The Ten of Coins.
